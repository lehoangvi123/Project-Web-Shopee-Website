<h1>Project-Web-Shopee-Website</h1>
<p>
    This project is my first step into web development, focusing on building a simple yet effective 
    front-end web project using HTML and CSS. The project is inspired by e-commerce layouts and demonstrates 
    my ability to structure and style web pages for modern web applications.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
    <strong>E-Commerce Layout:</strong> A foundational design inspired by popular online shopping platforms.<br>
    <strong>HTML/CSS Implementation:</strong> Built using clean and structured HTML for content and CSS for styling.<br>
    <strong>Branching Instructions:</strong> Includes instructions for navigating between branches (e.g., main or master branch).
</p>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>
    Develop and showcase front-end web development skills.<br>
    Learn and implement the use of version control systems like Git.<br>
    Build a responsive layout suitable for beginner-level e-commerce projects.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
    Please switch to the <strong>master</strong> branch for the most up-to-date version of the project. While it is fine 
    to use the main branch, the <strong>master</strong> branch is the primary working branch for this project.
